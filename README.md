## Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview:
This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on various attributes. The project involves data analysis, model development, and evaluation to provide insights into potential indicators of heart disease and to build predictive models for early detection.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project (Hd.csv) comprises information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes that are known to be associated with heart disease. Additionally, the dataset includes a target variable indicating whether an individual has heart disease or not.

## Analysis Process:
The project follows a structured analysis process:

## Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, cleaning the data, and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating summary statistics, distributions, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
Model Development: Training multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to predict heart disease.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained models based on their accuracy scores on both training and testing datasets.
Prediction: Demonstrating how the trained model can be used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease for new data samples.
Usage:
## To replicate or explore the analysis:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction.git

Install the required libraries: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis.
## Conclusion:
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques for early detection of heart disease, which can potentially contribute to better healthcare outcomes by identifying individuals at risk and enabling timely intervention.
